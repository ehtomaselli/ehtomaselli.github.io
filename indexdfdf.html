	<p>Mr. Demeter is a god amoung men. gives amazing life lessons but doesn't really teach the curriculum  </p>
<p>OMG I LOVE MR. DEMETER HE IS MY FAVORITE TEACHER. MEEW.  Mr. Demeter is awesome! He knows a lot of interesting things and is very knowledgeable. He goes on a lot of tangents during class, and he doesn't really teach... and can get very cranky at the end of the day.  Mr. Demeter is awesome! He is like a living wikipedia, he knows a lot about random subjects. If you get him you will definitely hear some of his tangents and they're hilarious, but they eat up class time sometimes and you end up having to study more individually at home. He gives really long readings, which can take a while if you're a procrastinator like me. His tests can be tricky and he asks questions on the smallest little details sometimes, so be ready to know more than just main ideas.  Mr. Demeter is an excellent teacher!</p>
<p>He is so reasonable. If you derp and forget to hand in homework, he lets you just hand it in later. He is chill with deadlines. Also, he is really nice and teaches you a lot! The one thing is that sometimes his anecdotes (which are funny sometimes) can get a little excessive.  Mr Demeter is amazing! He understands us, BCA kids and tries to adjust. Not only that but he's a VERY knowledgable person with some great anecdotes! His tests are okay compared to others and I think he might be my favorite teacher thus far. </p>

<p> Mr Demeter is really amazing! His stories are just so random and hilarious! Hes a really knowledgeable person though but if you ask a question, it might spark or ignite something and he can end up talking for the whole perioD XD hes great ! Mr. Demeter is psycho... he's hilarious and his class is actually really fun when he goes off topic and rants about random things, but although he knows everything about everything, I don't learn much. Also, he gets you used to taking note card quizzes and all of a sudden makes you take tests without them. He's an impossible grader and apparently 'doesn't believe in A's" Chill guy, knows what he's talking about, and really entertaining when he goes off on tangents (which is frequently). Be sure to study hard for quizzes and tests, though. Perhaps one of the greatest teachers I have ever had in any subject.  coolest teacher ever funny and smart  knows his stuff :)  He's... amazing. I go up to him for one mod before his two mod class to review for a common assessment, and he just sits and down and starts talking to me until his next class waits at his door. He realizes he went overtime, so he mutters to himself, and he lets the next class in. He gets off-topic, but he's really knowledgeable about pretty much everything in history. We ask him something random, and he'll answer in 5-10 min, explaining almost everything about it. A lot of tangents, but whatever. Amazing.he's nice but hard tests </p>
<p>he's pretty cool. even though he has his mood swings... =)  </p>
<p>best teacher everrrr by far for freshman. ask him about his favortie animal, octopus.  mr. demeter is amazing! he's funny and nice and really helpful. i haven't met anyone who doesn't like him. his review sessions for the midterms helped a lot. i wish i could have had him for early america.  </p>
<p>i have him for bill of rights and hes awesome but i wish i had him for early america because i hear hes a really good teacher </p>
<p>One of those rare teachers who both teach well and let you have fun. He doesnt let your performance in his class affect how he sees you performance. Cares more about getting work done than due dates. Great club moderator (JSA) and good friend to a lot of students. Is a little ADD though (He'll tell you that he is on the first day of class.) There is a decent amount of work for his class and tests can be hard. Interesting class!  </p>
<p> hes kinda fidgety and ADD-ish, but hes really nice and funny. his stories are amazing, and we always went off on tangents cause he knows the most random little details about every historical event of all the teachers i have, his tests are the hardest, but he's really funny and our class gets off track a lot. </p>
