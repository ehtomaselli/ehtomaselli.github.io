<h2> A General Overview of Many of the Common Health Concerns Faced by Teenagers </h2>
<body>
	<p> I'm not going to sugar coat it. Being a teenager can really suck. Chances are you've already realized this. Congrats. Hopefully, we at HealthAnon can make your teenage years a little less shitty and a little more positive. Below is a list of common issues faced by many teenagers. If you're uncomfortable talking to a friend or a doctor, utilize our many resources to familiarize yourself with whatever you're going through. You can ask a doctor for advice, share your experiences, and ask others for their personal stories. As the name implies, this website is completely anonymous. Athough this website is not a substitute for professional care, it can help you feel more comfortable with your situation, and can still be a help even for those who choose not to see a doctor. </p>

	<p><b><u>Common Concerns</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Mental</b></p>
	<p>Common mental challenges include depression, anxiety, eating disorders, multiple-personality disorders, addictions, and obsessive-complusive disorders. These conditions are normal, and are experienced by approximately one in every five teenagers. If you believe you or a friend may be experiencing any of these, there are a few things you can do. First, get educated. Believe it or not, not everything on the internet is true. We've compliled a reliable list of sources on many of these conditions. Second, talk to someone. It doesn't matter if it's a friend, parent, sibling, a stranger on a forum pst, or even one of us (check our contact page for more info.) Finally, talk to a doctor. You can contact a professional through our site, to get profession opinion. This personal, professional advice can help you decide what course to take. </p>

	<p><b>Sexual</b></p>
	<p>As much as your 5th grade health teacher tried to dissuade you with the line "Do Not Have Sex, Because You WILL Get Pregnant and Die, you've probably started to consider becoming sexually active. Whether you have or haven't, it's important to educate yourself on the decision to have sex before engaging in the act. Think of this as your all access guide to the question about sex, pregnency, and STDS that you were too embarrased to ask your parents.</p>

	<p><b>Drugs and Alchol Related</b></p>
	<p> Teens are infamous for experimentation. No amount of drug-prevention programs will completely eliminate the use of drugs and alcohol amoung teens, so the next best thing is to educate you on the things. </p>
